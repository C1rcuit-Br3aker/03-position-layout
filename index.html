          You have to try this recipe! You may have seen it recently break Reddit and Buzzfeed. It popped
          up as a submission from an 80 grandmother in AOL chat last week and Buzzfeed cannot stop talking about it. It made
          it's rounds on 9gag, before gaining traction in r/pizza. It's only a matter of
          time before the hacker known as 4chan removes the recipe from the internet, so get it while you still can.
